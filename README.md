In this project, I design a model can receive two form of input (image and text) then generate the final classification results.

To run the code, 

1. download the image_data.zip from the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h0DLyeVtm9rnZqrC36o_fVtnvZ_hxrY5/view?usp=sharing and put the zip file into the same folder with Multi-Modal-Classification-Model.ipynb file.
2. run Multi-Modal-Classification-Model.ipynb.
